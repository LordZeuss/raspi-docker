#This is a script to install essential and or useful programs for Docker.

#A list is provided below, as well as on the Github Page with the included programs.

#This script is designed to add the containers after installing Docker from this repo. If your docker-compose.yml file is located elsewhere, you will need to change the location in the script so the containers are added.

## Included Containers:
#	Portainer	-Container manager for docker (ESSENTIAL)
#	Pi-Hole 	-DNS sinkhole; ad and telemetry adblocker
